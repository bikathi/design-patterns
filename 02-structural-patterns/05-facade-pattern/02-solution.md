- A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts.
- A facade might provide limited functionality compared to working with the subsystem directly, but those features
  are usually what clients really care about.
- Having a facade comes in handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens
  of features, but you need just a tiny bit of its functionality.
