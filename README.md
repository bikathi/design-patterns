# What is a 'Design Pattern'
- Is a typical solution to commonly occuring problems in software design. Think of it like a pre-made blue print you can
customise to solve a recurring design problem in code.
- Rather than a piece of code, these are concepts used for solving particular problems.

# Characteristics of Patterns
Here are the sections that are usually present for any given pattern
1. **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
2. **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
3. **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related
4. **Code example** in a common programming language, to make it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

# Other Characteristics
Some other patterns include:
- **Applicability** of the pattern
- **Implementation** steps
- **Relations** with other patterns

# Classifications of Design Patterns
1. **Creational Patterns** - provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
2. **Structural Patterns** - explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures
flexible and efficient.
3. **Behavioral Patterns** - take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
