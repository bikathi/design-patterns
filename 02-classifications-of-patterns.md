# Classifications of Patterns
- Design patterns are classified based on their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being desgined.
- The most basic and low-level patterns are often called *idioms*, and usually apply only to a single programming language.
- The most universal and high level patterns are called *architectural patterns*, and can be implemented in virtually any language.
- In most cases, all patterns can be categorized by their **intent** or purpose, underwhich, we find three main groups of patterns:

1. **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase the flexibility and reuse of existing code. These include:
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder
  - Prototype
  - Singleton
2. **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. These include:
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy
3. **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. These include:
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command
  - Iterator
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - Observer
  - State
  - Strategy
  - Template Method
  - Visitor
